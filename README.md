# A Prediction algorithm for number of new cases

This New_Corona_Cases_prediction helps to guess the number of new corona cases in a particular country(I used India).

The dataset is downloaded from WHO site which contains features "Date_reported", "Country_code","Country","WHO_region","New_cases","Cumulative_cases","New_deaths",	 "Cumulative_deaths". I have extracted all data coresponding to INDIA.

The prediction is based on "month", "date", "new-cases".
